# Joke-Ruiner
Daniel Gieseke | September 2023

This project takes in jokes from a joke API, separates the jokes between the questions and answers, then provides mismatched jokes, effectively ruining perfectly good jokes. This project is a practice of pulling from APIs and manipulating text using Python.

'setup': "Why can't bicycles stand on their own?"
